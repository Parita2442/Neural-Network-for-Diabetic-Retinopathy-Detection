# Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy through Fundus Images

**Motivation:** <br>
According to the International Diabetes Federation, the occurrence of diabetes in the adult population (20-79 years) is projected to increase by 46% by the year 2045. Diabetic retinopathy is a consequential complication of diabetes, characterized by damage to the retina at the back of the eye. If left untreated, DR can lead to loss of vision, hence early detection is imperative. This is where machine learning comes in, we aim to use deep networks to identify and detect symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy to provide necessary treatment.<br>

**Dataset:** <br>
The dataset comprises of fundus images in IDRiD captured by a retinal specialist at an Eye Clinic located in Nanded, Maharashtra, India, with reasonable mixture of disease stratification representative of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) is present. The data also provides information regarding disease severity level of DR and DME. The grading for all images is available in the CSV file categorized according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale: <br>
0 - No abnormalities, <br>
1 - Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, <br>
2 - Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, <br>
3 - Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, <br>
4 - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy.<br>
The dataset has 516 images with a resolution of 4288Ã—2848 pixels stored in jpg file format. The size of each image is about 800 KB.<br>
